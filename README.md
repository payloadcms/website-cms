### Running locally

You can clone this repo to your own computer and play around super easily.

To do so, you'll need the following software:

- Yarn or NPM
- NodeJS version 10+
- A Mongo Database - **IMPORTANT: you need to either have MongoDB running locally, or have signed up for a free MongoDB Atlas server in order to test this repo locally.**

##### Local installation steps:

**1. Clone the repo by running the following command at your terminal:**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:payloadcms/website-cms.git
```

**Navigate to the folder and install dependencies**

Type `cd ./website-cms` and then `yarn` or `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` to add all required dependencies.

**Duplicate the example `.env` file and fill in your own values**

Type `cp .env.example .env` in your terminal to make a copy of the example `.env` file, and then edit that file to fill in your own values.


**Fire up the development server**

Finally, type `yarn dev` to start up the server and see it in action!

### Connect your local cms to the Payload website

Update NEXT_PUBLIC_CMS_URL in payload website `.env` file 

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CMS_URL=http://cms.local.payloadcms.com:8000
```

### Hosts file

The locally running app must run on `cms.local.payloadcms.com:8000` because of http-only cookie policies and how the GitHub App redirects the user back to the site after authenticating. To do this, you'll need to add the following to your hosts file:

```
127.0.0.1 cms.local.payloadcms.com
```

> On Mac you can find the hosts file at `/etc/hosts`. On Windows, it's at `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`:
